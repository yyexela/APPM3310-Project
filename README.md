## CSV Files

Git doesn't allow you to upload files larger than 25MB, so download the CSV files from the Google Drive folder into the `/InputCSV` folder

## Files

makefile:
- Compiles parse-csv.cc by running `make` in the directory on the command line
- Cleans the directory by running `make clean`

parse-csv.cc
- Program that parses through the files in `InputCSV` and stores the resulting values in an array of linked-lists
